🎵 Spotify Clone (Web Music Player)

A fully responsive Spotify Clone built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that replicates the core look and feel of the Spotify web player. This project focuses on front-end development concepts such as UI design, DOM manipulation, audio handling, and responsive layouts.

📌 Project Overview

The Spotify Clone is a browser-based music player that allows users to play, pause, skip, and control audio tracks with a clean and modern interface inspired by Spotify. It is designed as a frontend-only project, making it ideal for beginners to understand how real-world music applications work at the UI level.

This project demonstrates how HTML structures the content, CSS styles and animates the interface, and JavaScript controls the music playback logic.
